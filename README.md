# [ROC Method for Identifying the Optimal Threshold With an Application to Email Classification](https://github.com/DataHub ElfbeeTay/ROCMethodForOptimalPerformanceInSpamClassification)

This is a project i did for my undergraduate research paper, where I compare the performance of Naïve Bayes, KNN, SVM and Neural Network using ROC curve and other metrics such as Accuracy, F1, Precision, and Recall. And also to determine that the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve (AUC) provides a better measure than accuracy

The objectives are to:
* develop a machine learning system for email classification.
* compare the performance of Naïve Bayes, KNN, SVM and Neural Network classifiers; and
* benchmark the system using dataset from UCI repository

The project write was published as a book chapter in the Handbook of Intelligent Computing and Optimization for Sustainable Development, Wiley Online Library (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119792642.ch16). 

# [First RShiny App](https://github.com/DataHub-ElfbeeTay/Rshiny)

This is a project I did for FREDACOM, where the age of the governor and their respectively deputy governors were compared across all the states in Nigeria.
* The data was sourced in 2022 from different website reporting the age of the governor and deputy governor in Nigeria.
* Barplot was used to compare their ages across each state and also there is an option to compare across the various states too.
